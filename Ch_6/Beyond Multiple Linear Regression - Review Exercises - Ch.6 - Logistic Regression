Notes:

- grid.arrange()
- Wald confidence interval and profile likelihood confidence interval are two different objects, but same in flavour
- data prepping, turning objects into factors with labels, use of table() for confirmation
- filtering on filter(complete.cases(.)) - returns logical vector on cases that are complete
- use of cut_number() to simplify groupings
- different ways of applyin gfactors to a model
- multiple models being included in a drop in deviance test - must be nested
