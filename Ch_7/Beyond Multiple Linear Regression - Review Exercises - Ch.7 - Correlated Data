Beyond Multiple Linear Regression - Review Exercises - Ch.7 - Correlated Data

Notes:

- Correlated data often takes on a multilevel structure. That is, population elements are grouped into aggregates, and we often have information on both the individual elements and the aggregated groups.
- For instance, students are grouped by teacher, weekly depression measures are grouped by patient, and survey respondents are grouped by household. In these cases, we refer to levels of measurement and observational units at each level. For example, students might represent level-one observational units, while teachers representlevel-two observational units, where level one is the most basic level
of observation, and level-one observations are aggregated to form level-two observations.

Guided Exercises

Exercise 1

a) What values do beta random variables take on?
- it takes on values within a finite interval. The standard beta distribtuion uses the interval [0,1] to obtain values.

b) What do these values represent for the dams and pups simulation?

These values represent the probabilities of a dam producing a defect in their pup.

c) Do the possible values depend on alpha or beta?

- yes, these are the shape parameters of the distribution.

d) What is a feature of the beta density when alpha = beta?

- distribution is symmetric

e) What happens to the density when alpha != beta?

- asymmetric distribution

f) How does the magnitude of alpha or beta affect the density?

- makes the density steeper

g) How does the difference between alpha and beta affect the density?

- difference between the values makes the distribution more asymmetric. If difference close to 0 distribtuion is more symmetric

h) If you wanted to simulate dams with mostly low probabilities of defects and a few with very high probabilities, how would you
do it?

- high beta, low alpha

i) If you wanted to simulate dams with mostly high probabilities of defects and a few with very low probabilities, how would you
do it?

- high alpha, low beta

j) If you wanted to simulate a population of dams where half of the probabilities of defects are very high and half are very low,
how would you do it?

- alpha and beta both equal and less than 1.
