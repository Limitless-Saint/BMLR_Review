Exercise 1

a) What values do beta random variables take on?
- it takes on values within a finite interval. The standard beta distribtuion uses the interval [0,1] to obtain values.

b) What do these values represent for the dams and pups simulation?

These values represent the probabilities of a dam producing a defect in their pup.

c) Do the possible values depend on alpha or beta?

- yes, these are the shape parameters of the distribution.

d) What is a feature of the beta density when alpha = beta?

- distribution is symmetric

e) What happens to the density when alpha != beta?

- asymmetric distribution

f) How does the magnitude of alpha or beta affect the density?

- makes the density steeper

g) How does the difference between alpha and beta affect the density?

- difference between the values makes the distribution more asymmetric. If difference close to 0 distribtuion is more symmetric

h) If you wanted to simulate dams with mostly low probabilities of defects and a few with very high probabilities, how would you
do it?

- high beta, low alpha

i) If you wanted to simulate dams with mostly high probabilities of defects and a few with very low probabilities, how would you
do it?

- high alpha, low beta

j) If you wanted to simulate a population of dams where half of the probabilities of defects are very high and half are very low,
how would you do it?

- alpha and beta both equal and less than 1.
